Questions

1) Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name
 
     - For this search, I would go through the ORM to avoid the need to pull
       all of the taxpayers out of the database.

2) Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend

   - I would use an iterative search since the list is unsorted and short.

3) Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size,
   search for a planet with a given size.

   - Since the list is sorted, I would use a binary search which would be quicker
     than an iterative search.

4) Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints

   - Since the list is unsorted, I would use an iterative search.
